# Simple Rust Thread Pool





The `sender` in the thread pool implementation is part of an MPSC (multi-producer, single-consumer) channel used for sending tasks to worker threads. Here's a detailed explanation of its role:

1. **Channel Creation**: `mpsc::channel()` creates a new channel consisting of a sender (`sender`) and a receiver (`receiver`). The sender allows you to send messages (in this case, jobs) to the receiver.

2. **Submitting Tasks**: When you call the `execute` method, the task is wrapped in a `Box` and sent to the channel using `self.sender.send(job)`. This is how you submit work to the thread pool.

3. **Worker Threads**: Each worker thread listens for tasks by calling `receiver.recv()`. When a task is received, the thread executes it.

4. **Concurrency**: This design allows multiple threads to submit tasks concurrently (multiple producers) while the worker threads consume and execute tasks one at a time (single consumer).

In summary, the `sender` is crucial for enabling communication between the main thread (or any other thread submitting jobs) and the worker threads in the pool, facilitating efficient task execution.
